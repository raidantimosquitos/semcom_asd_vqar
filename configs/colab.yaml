# Colab: longer epochs, paths for /content or Google Drive.
# Use after uploading dataset and project to Colab (or mounting Drive).
#
# 1) Set data.root_dir to your dataset path (e.g. /content/dataset or /content/drive/MyDrive/...)
# 2) Set phase1.checkpoint and phase2.checkpoint to save under /content or Drive so they persist.
